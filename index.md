#### Conflict Plan: 
Our group process to resolve conflict, when it arises it does not make it happen with the organization and distribute work. If it happens, we can use our sense of knowledge and solve it together.

My concerns to members who are not adequately contributing are to encourage him and try to help him. and I will surely alert him if he did not respond. we are a group we need to work together I will not try to escalate the conflict between team members.

•	Our strategy in this group to listen to everyone's opinion, which will ensure everyone’s voice is heard that creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up.


#### Work Plan

I will share the repository with my teammates by making a New organization and make a new repo for the project, and we will work on branches and keep updating it, anyone on our team can clone the branch and edit it and then push it and make a pull request and then we can see his work and decide to merge it or not. Only the team leader will accept the merging branches.
